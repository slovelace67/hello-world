About Me: Hello, it's Sharon here. I'm a former fraud investigator for the now defunct Continental Airlines (bought by United) and I'm also a former 11th grade English teacher, my most recent career. I'm ready for another self-reinvention, this time merging themes from my past such as investigation and research while gaining technical skills to get to know my target better. Focus: Git and GitHub and all they have to offer so that I may dig deeper and become a better detective.
